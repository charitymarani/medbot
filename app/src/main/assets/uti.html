    <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Urinary tract infections(UTIs) are common infections that can affect the badder,kidneys and the tubes connected to them.</p>
        <p>Anyone can get them, but they're particularly common in women. Some women experience them regularly(called recurrent UTIs)</p>
        <p>UTIs ca be painful and uncomfortable,but usually pass within a few days and be easily treated with antibiotics.</p>
        <h4>Symptoms of UTIs</h4>
        <p>Infections of the bladder(cystitis)or urethra(tube that carries urine out of the body) are known as lower UTIs.They can cause :</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Needing to pee suddenly or more often than usual</li>
        <li>Pain or a burning sensation when peeing</li>
        <li>Pain in your lower tummy</li>
        <li>Feeling tired and unwell</li>
        <li>Smelly or cloudy pee</li>
        <li>Feeling as though you are unable to empty your bladder fully</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Infections of the kidneys or ureters(tubes connecting kidneys to bladder)are known as upper UTIs.These can cause the above symptoms and also :</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Fever of 38c or above</li>
        <li>Pain in your sides or back</li>
        <li>Shivering and chills</li>
        <li>Feeling and being sick</li>
        <li>Confusion</li>
        <li>Agitation and restlessness</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Lower UTIs are common and aren't usually a cause of major concern.Upper UTIs can be serious if left untreated,as they could damage the kidneys or spread to the bloodstream.</p>
        <h4>Treating UTIs</h4>
        <p>UTIs are normally treated with a short course of antibiotics.</p>
        <p>Most women are given a three-day course of antibiotics capsules or tablets.Men,pregnant women and people with more serious symptoms may need a slightly longer course.</p>
        <p>Your symptoms will normally pass within three to five days of starting treatment.But make sure you complete the whole course of antibiotics that you've been prescribed,even if you are feeling better.</p>
        <p>Over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol can help with any pain.Drinking plenty of fluids may also help you feel better.</p>
        <p>It may also help to avoid having sex until you feel better. You can't pass a UTI on to your partner  but sex may be uncomfortable.
</p>
        <h4>Causes of UTIs</h4>
        <p>UTIs occur when the urinary tract becomes infected,usually by bacteria.In most cases,bacteria from the gut enter the urinary tract through the urethra.</p>
        <p>This may occur when wiping your bottom or having sex,for example,but often it's not clear why it happens.</p>
        <p>Women have a shorter urethra than men. This means bacteria are more likely to reach the bladder or kidneys and cause an infection.
</p>
        <p>The following may increase your risk of getting a UTI :</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Pregnancy</li>
        <li>Conditions that block the urinary tract – such as kidney stones</li>
        <li>Conditions that make it difficult to fully empty the bladder – such as an enlarged prostate gland in men and constipation in children</li>
        <li>Urinary catheters (a tube in your bladder used to drain urine)</li>
        <li>Having a weakened immune system – for example, from type 2 diabetes, chemotherapy or HIV</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Preventing UTIs</h4>
        <p>If you get UTIs frequently,there are some things you can try that may stop it fro coming back.However,it's not clear how effective these measures are.</p>
        <h5>DOs</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>Wipe from front to back when you go to the toilet</li>
        <li>Try to fully empty your bladder when you pee</li>
        <li>Drink plenty of fluids</li>
        <li>Take showers instead of baths</li>
        <li>Wear loose cotton underwear</li>
        <li>Pee as soon as possible after sex</li>
        <li>Change your baby's or toddler's nappies regularly</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>DONTs</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>Use perfumed bubble bath, soap or talcum powder</li>

        <h4>Natural remedies</h4>
        <p>There is very little evidence that drinking cranberry juice or using probiotics reduces your chance of getting UTIs.</p>
